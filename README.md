This project is part of <a href='theodinproject.com'>The Odin Project</a> Final Rails project. 

It's my first project of this scope and it is still under construction. I plan to get back on it to add more functionality, fix logging in through Facebook and other styling stuff. Hopefully I could look back to it in the future as my cute start in coding.
